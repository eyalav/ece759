For redcution, all the files are in ArrayReduction folder. 
Makefile generates executable q1.out
Report is in the file COMMENTS.pdf

For matrix multiplication, the report file COMMENTS.pdf 
can be found in either Tiled_matrixmul or Scaling folders.
In both the folders, Makefile generates executable q2.out
The difference here being, the code in Scaling folder
has been modified to handle 2 argument case. In this case,
assuming user want to multiply 2 random sqaure matrices,
argv[1] and argv[2] represent square matrix dimentiosn.
So you can run the code as "q2.out 1024 1024"

Inside Tiled_matrixmul folder, the data folder has logs
that are used to answer Q1, 2, 3.

Inside Scaling folder, the data folder has logs
that are used to answer Q4, 5, 6, 7.

PS: Last minute addition
For Q7, the test might fail also because floating
point computations are not entirely associative.
This, along with small difference accumulating
over large row size, can cause the the test to fail.
